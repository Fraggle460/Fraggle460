⚡ Fun fact: I love movies of all genres! From the plot to character arcs to set design to the soundtrack. From a very
young age, I found solace in the fantasy of films and TV, (hence how I got the nickname “Fraggle Rock”).
I am an avid gamer, with a specific penchant for action-adventure game series on PlayStation such as
God of War, Uncharted, Call of Duty and Marvel’s Spiderman. I also love travelling, which affords me a
better appreciation of the sights, sounds, culture and people of the world (e.g. when I learned Swahili while
working in Tanzania).
